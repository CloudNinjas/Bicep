# Bicep

## What is Bicep?

Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively. It aims to drastically simplify the authoring experience with a cleaner syntax, improved type safety, and better support for modularity and code re-use.

## Why Bicep?

Bicep is a **new** language that is: 

* **concise**: You can now deploy resources with fewer lines of code.
* **structured**: You are no longer required to build JSON strings. You can now use indentation and comments to structure your code.
* **strongly typed**: You no longer need to remember property names. Intellisense is available to show available properties.
* **self-describing**: You no longer need to reference documentation to understand what a property does.
* **composable**: You can now reference and parameterize templates and modules.
* **secure**: You no longer need to handle escaping quotes and other special characters. Bicep will take care of that for you.


## How do I get started?

You can get started by installing the Bicep CLI and VS Code extension. You can also try Bicep in the [Bicep Playground](https://aka.ms/bicepdemo).
